# My life through your eyes
## Introduction
Welcome to the **Through your eyes app**.
For my final project at Ironhack I've decided to make an app where parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, babysitters, etc. can write small memories about a childs day.
## Description
The frontend is built with React
This is a basic CRUD app made with node.js & express
In this app you can read stories other users wrote or write some yourself if you're logged in.
The users can decide if they want to have the stories they wrote public or private, edit the stories and ofcourse delete the stories.

## How to run the app

Add your PORT, MONGODB_URI and SESS_SECRET credentials to the .env file

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development
npm run dev

# Run in production
npm start
```

## Suggestions

Let me know if you have suggestions to improve the code, I would love to hear it and learn even more!
